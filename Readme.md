#ESP32_GeTCryptoRates

!(IMG_4527.JPG)

Simple project makes use of a HelTech ESP32 with onboard OLED screen, for collecting and displaying the crypto currency exchange rates. The project uses http://api.cryptocompare.com to collect up to seven currencies (limited by lines on OLED screen) and will display them in USD, GBP or EURO. Alter 'select_base_currency' to change this.

Note: This was developed using the Arduino IDE, but I went throught split out all the classes into separate modules.
